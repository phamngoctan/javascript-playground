# Javascript in 2 days

## Javascript day 1 and 2 - basic course

### Section 1: Getting started
#### What is Javascript
One of the most popular programmming language =))
#### What can we do with Javascript

- For a long time, it is only used on browser. A toy language for dev.
- Not anymore, used for Web/Mobile Apps, real-time networking apps, games
#### Where it can be run?
Run in browser with Javascript Engine:
- Firefox: SpiderMonkey
- Chrome: V8

In 2008, Ryan Dahl took the open source javascript engine in Chrome and embedded it inside a C++ program. He called Node. Browsers and Node can provide the runtime env for JS.

ECMA scripts: specification
Javascript: programming language

#### Development tool

- VS code
- Node JS installed
- Live Server plugin in VS code

### Section 2: Basic

- Variables, Constants
- Primitive types - 5 types: string, number, boolean, undefined, null
- Dynamic type, type of variable will be determined at runtime
- Objects (Reference types)
- Arrays: data structure to store list of items
- Functions
- Types of Functions

### Section 3: Operators

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Equality operators: strict equality ===, lose equality ==
- Ternary operators: conditional operator
- Logical operators: short-circuiting in OR operator
- Bitwise operators

### Section 4: Control flow

- for...in: iterate over the property of the object
- for...of: iterate over the element or item

### Section 5: Objects

- Factory function
- Constructor function
- Dynamic Nature of Objects (Possible to add more properties outside of the class)
- Function is object
- Ways to loop through all keys (properties) in an object
- Clone an object
- GC in JS (GC auto de-allocate the memory - nothing to do here)
- Built-in object - Math
- Built-in object - String
- Template literal - format a string the way we wants it looks like
- Date API


### Section 6: Arrays

- Array built-in method
    - push
    - unshift
    - splice
    - indexOf
    - lastIndexOf
    - includes
    - find item in array of object using function
- Arrow Functions
- Combine arrays using the "Spread" Operator


### Section 7: Functions
Functions are objects

- Functions expressions
- Hoisting (the process of moving function declaration to the top of the file by JavaScript Engine automatically)
- The rest operator (...args)
    It is different with the SPREAD operator in an array
- Local & global scope
- let vs var keyword - should avoid var keyword :)
- this keyword - for object and for function
