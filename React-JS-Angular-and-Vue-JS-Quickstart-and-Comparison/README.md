# Getting started

- The term vanilla script is used to refer to the pure JavaScript :)
- jQuery
- Low dash (lo_)
- VueJS
- Understand other Parts of the JavaScript World
    - Other versions of Javascript (ES6, ES5, TypeScript (TS) developed by Microsoft, base on Javascript)
    - Build tool (Webpack, Babel) minimize, optimise code, bundle, enable features, turn ES6 codes into ES5 codes and make sure it run successfully on browser only supporting ES5
    - Libraries (jQuery, LowDash)
    - Frameworks (VueJS, ReactJS, AngularJS)
- Detail about the ES6 and TypeScript, Webpack
    - ES6: next version of JS, add new features (classes, arrow functions, ...), not supported by all browsers.
        - Babel: transplier ES6 => ES5
    - TypeScript: superset to Javascript => needs to be compiled to Javascript, added features like Types, Interfaces, Generics, ...
    - Webpact: Bundler => allows you to split JS code over multiple Files and ship one bundle in the end. (not so clear for me)

# VueJS

- v-model= two ways binding to input field
- v-for=
- v-on:click=
- v-bind:class=
- Vue component
- npm
- Webpack
  - entry (root directory)
  - output (output file with directory)
- Deployment for different platforms

Last feeling, the deployment for PROD environment is quite easy to setup. I really like it.
